## Project Description

This project involves implementing a CNN model to first classify good and bad cleave images uploaded from the user. The images are produced by THORLABS Fiber Cleave Analyzer (FCA) with cleaves produced by the LDC400. If a bad cleave image is obtained, a second, regression-based model is implemented to predict the optimal parameters for producing a good cleave. As of now the model is only capable or predicting tension. A command line interface is provided for training and testing either the CNN model or the regression model. To install, please clone the repository and install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file

## Key Features

This project used a transfer learning model using MobileNetV2 as the base input for the CNN model. After freezing the top layers, I implemented two fully connected layers with parameters determined using Keras Tuner. This was for the image branch of the model. A second branch uses numerical features as input, which is then concatenated with the image branch to produce the full model. For the regression model, I used the dropout layer of the CNN model and then implemented more specific logic to predict the optimal tension.

## Getting Started 

A CLI lets the user train and test the model using different option implemented in a JSON file which is then passed in the CLI through the --file_path option. An example structure of the JSON config file is as follows:
